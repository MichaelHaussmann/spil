USING DEMO CONFIGURATION

Spil needs configuration files in the pythonpath.
("spil_sid_conf.py" and others) 

None were found, so Spil is falling back to the shipped demo configuration.
The demo configuration is located here: "{default_sid_conf_path}".

You may adapt this demo configuration to your needs, or create a configuration on your own. 
Once you add your configuration folder to the pythonpath, this message will disappear.

Please see the documentation : https://spil.readthedocs.io

    CONFIGURATION PROBLEM: 

    The configuration module "{module}" was not found.

    Ensure to either include the demo "hamlet_conf" in your python path, 
    or create your own "{module}" and add its folder to the python path.    

    (If you are running a py.test edit the SPIL_CONF_PATH variable in tests/test_00_init.py to match a python path.)

    Please see installation and configuration documentation.
